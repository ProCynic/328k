\begin{thm}
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. If $(a, b) = 1$, then there exist
integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = 1$. \end{thm}

\begin{thm}
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers. If there exist integers $x$ and $y$
with $ax + by = 1$, then $(a, b) = 1$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.40%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
For any integers $a$ and $b$ not both $0$, there are integers $x$
and $y$ such that \[ax + by = (a, b).\]
