Chapter 4 is the culmination of all of your inquiries from the first
three chapters. After not looking at the material for a day or two,
take a blank piece of paper and outline the development of the first
four chapters in as much detail as you can without referring to the
text or to notes. Places where you get stuck or can't remember
