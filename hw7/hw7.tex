%%%Theorem 2.1%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
If $n$ is a natural number greater than $1$, then there exists a
prime $p$ such that $p|n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]

\end{proof}

%%%Exercise 2.2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{exer}
Write down the primes less than $100$ without the aid of a
calculator or a table of primes and think about how you decide
whether each number you select is prime or not.
\end{exer}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Type your solution here!
\end{proof}

%%%Theorem 2.3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
A natural number $n>1$ is prime if and only if for all primes $p
\leq \sqrt{n}$, $p$ does not divide $n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!

%%%Exercise 2.4%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{exer}
Use the preceding theorem to verify that $101$ is prime.

%%%Exercise 2.5%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{exer}[Sieve of Eratosthenes]\index{Sieve of Eratosthenes}
Write down all the natural numbers from $1$ to $100$, perhaps on a
$10 \times 10$ array. Circle the number $2$, the smallest prime.
Cross off all numbers divisible by $2$.  Circle $3$, the next number
that is not crossed out.  Cross off all larger numbers that are
divisible by $3$. Continue to circle the smallest number that is not
crossed out and cross out its multiples. Repeat.  Why are the
circled numbers all the primes less than $100$?
\end{exer}


%%% Note: I recommend printing this and crossing off the multiples of primes by hand. 
%% For the electronic version, you can just list the circled primes. Or, if you want to get fancy, 
% you can use \cancel{2} to cross out multiples. That one, for example, would put a line through 2. 
% The trick is, you have to be in math mode, so it's a little annoying!

%%%Theorem 2.7%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}[Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic-Existence Part)]
Every natural number greater than $1$ is either a prime number or it
can be expressed as a finite product of prime numbers. That is, for
every natural number $n$ greater than $1$, there exist distinct
primes $p_1, p_2, \hdots, p_m$ and natural numbers $r_1, r_2,
\hdots, r_m$ such that \[n = p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2}\cdots p_m^{r_m}.\]
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]

%%%Lemma 2.8%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{lem}
Let $p$ and $q_1, q_2, \hdots, q_n$ all be primes and let $k$ be a
natural number such that~$p k = q_1q_2 \cdots q_n$.  Then $p = q_i$
for some $i$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}


%%%Theorem 2.9%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}[Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic-Uniqueness part]
Let $n$ be a natural number.  Let $\{p_1, p_2, \hdots, p_m\}$ and
$\{q_1, q_2, \hdots, q_s\}$ be sets of primes with $p_i \neq p_j$ if
$i \neq j$ and $q_i \neq q_j$ if $i \neq j$. Let $\{r_1, r_2,
\hdots, r_m\}$ and $\{t_1, t_2, \hdots, t_s\}$ be sets of natural
numbers such that
\begin{align*}
n & = p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2}\cdots p_m^{r_m} \\
  & = q_1^{t_1}q_2^{t_2}\cdots q_s^{t_s}.
\end{align*}
Then $m = s$ and $\{p_1, p_2, \hdots, p_m\} = \{q_1, q_2, \hdots,
q_s\}$. That is, the sets of primes are equal but their elements are
not necessarily listed in the same order; that is, $p_i$ may or may
not equal $q_i$.  Moreover, if~$p_i = q_j$ then $r_i = t_j$.  In
other words, if we express the same natural number as a product of
powers of distinct primes, then the expressions are identical except
for the ordering of the factors.
