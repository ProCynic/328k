%%%Theorem 2.32%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
For all natural numbers $n$, $(n,n + 1) = 1$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}


%%%Theorem 2.33%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $k$ be a natural number.  Then there exists a natural number $n$
(which will be much larger than $k$) such that no natural number
less than $k$ and greater than $1$ divides~$n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!

%%%Theorem 2.34%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $k$ be a natural number. Then there exists a prime larger than
$k$.
\end{thm}
