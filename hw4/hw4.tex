\begin{thm}
Prove the existence part of the Division Algorithm. (\textit{Hint}:
Given $n$ and $m$, how will you define $q$?  Once you choose this
$q$, then how is $r$ chosen?  Then show that $0 \leq r \leq n-1$.)
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.27%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
Prove the uniqueness part of the Division Algorithm.

(\textit{Hint}: If $nq + r = nq' + r'$, then $nq -nq' = r' - r$. Use
what you know about $r$ and $r'$ as part of your argument that $q =
q'$.)

\begin{exer}
Find the following greatest common divisors. Which pairs are
relatively prime?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(1)] $(36,22)$
    \item[(2)] $(45,-15)$
    \item[(3)] $(-296,-88)$

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.32%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $n$, $b$, $r$, and $k$ be integers. If $a = nb + r$ and
$k|a$ and $k|b$, then $k|r$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.33%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $b$, $n_1$, and $r_1$ be integers with $a$ and $b$ not both
$0$. If $a = n_1b + r_1$, then $(a, b) = (b , r_1)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.34%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{exer}
 As an illustration of the above theorem, note that
\begin{align*}
51 & = 3 \cdot 15 + 6, \\
15 & = 2 \cdot 6 + 3, \\
6 & = 2 \cdot 3 + 0.
\end{align*}
Use the preceding theorem to show that if $a = 51$ and $b = 15$,
then $(51, 15) = (6, 3) = 3$.
