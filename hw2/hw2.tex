%%%%%%%%%%%%1.15%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{exer}
Let $a$, $b$, and $n$ be integers with $n
> 0$.  Show that if $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$,
then $a^2 \equiv b^2 \pmod{n}$.
\end{exer}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.16%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{exer}
Let $a$, $b$, and $n$ be integers with $n
> 0$.  Show that if $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$,
then $a^3 \equiv b^3 \pmod{n}$.
\end{exer}

\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.17%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{exer}
Let $a$, $b$, $k$, and $n$ be integers with $n
> 0$ and $k > 1$. Show that if $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ and
$a^{k-1} \equiv b^{k-1} \pmod{n}$,
then \[a^k \equiv b^k \pmod{n}.\]
\end{exer}

\begin{proof}[Proof]

\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.18%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $b$, $k$, and $n$ be integers with $n
> 0$ and $k > 0$.  If $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$,
then \[a^k \equiv b^k \pmod{n}.\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.19%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{exer}
Illustrate each of Theorems $1.12$-$1.18$ with
an example using actual numbers.
\end{exer}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Example for 1.12:
\item Example for 1.13:
\item Example for 1.14:
\item Example for 1.15:
\item Example for 1.16:
\item Example for 1.17:
\item Example for 1.18:

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.20%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{ques}
Let $a$, $b$, $c$, and $n$ be integers for which $ac \equiv bc
\pmod{n}$. Can we conclude that $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$? If you answer
``yes", try and give a proof. If you answer ``no", try and give a
counterexample.

%%% Notice that the theorems below don't get included in the numbering system

%%%%%%%%%%%%A.10%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent \textbf{A.10 Theorem.} \emph{Let n be a natural number. Then $1+2+3+\cdots + n=\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%A.18%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent \textbf{A.18 Theorem.} \emph{For every natural number n,  $1+2+2^2+\cdots + 2^n=2^{n+1}-1$}
