\begin{thm}
Let a natural number $n$ be expressed in base $10$ as \[n = a_k
a_{k-1} \hdots a_1 a_0.\]  (Note that what we mean by this notation
is that each $a_i$ is a digit of a regular base $10$ number, not
that the $a_i$'s are being multiplied together.) If $m = a_k +
a_{k-1} + \hdots + a_1 + a_0$, then $n \equiv m \pmod{3}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.22%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
If a natural number is divisible by $3$, then, when expressed in
base $10$, the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.23%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
If the sum of the digits of a natural number expressed in base $10$
is divisible by $3$, then the number is divible by $3$ as well.

\begin{thm}
Prove the existence part of the Division Algorithm. (\textit{Hint}:
Given $n$ and $m$, how will you define $q$?  Once you choose this
$q$, then how is $r$ chosen?  Then show that $0 \leq r \leq n-1$.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.27%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
Prove the uniqueness part of the Division Algorithm.

(\textit{Hint}: If $nq + r = nq' + r'$, then $nq -nq' = r' - r$. Use
what you know about $r$ and $r'$ as part of your argument that $q =
q'$.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%1.28%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $b$, and $n$ be integers with $n > 0$.  Then $a \equiv b
\pmod{n}$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when
divided by $n$.  Equivalently, $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ if and only if
when $a = nq_1 + r_1$ ($0 \leq r_1 \leq n-1$) and $b = nq_2 + r_2$
($0 \leq r_2 \leq n-1$), then~$r_1 = r_2$.
