%%%Theorem 3.13%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{thm}
Suppose $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \hdots + a_0$ is a
polynomial of degree $n > 0$ with integer coefficients.  Then $f(x)$
is a composite number for infinitely many integers~$x$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Suppose $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \hdots + a_0$ is a polynomial of degree $n > 0$ with integer coefficients and $a_n > 0$.  We will show that $f(x)$ is a composite number for infinitely many integers $x$.  Let $S$ be the set of integers $x$ such that $f(x)$ is composite and let $T$ be the set of numbers $f(x)$ such that $x$ is an element of $S$.  Assume by way of contradiction that $S$ is finite.  Let $m$ be an element of $S$ such that $f(m)$ is the largest element of $T$.  By theorem 3.12, there exists an integer $k$ such that for all integers $j > k$, $f(j) > f(m)$.  Now consider these two cases: $a_0 = 0$ and $a_0 \neq 0$.\\
In the case that $a_0 \neq 0$, let $y = (k+1)\card{a_0}$.  Since $a_0 \neq 0$, $y$ must be greater than $k$.  Therefore $f(y) > f(m)$.  Also, $a_0 \mid y$, so $y \equiv 0 \pmod{a_0}$.  By theorem 3.8, this means that $f(y) \equiv f(0) \pmod{a_0}$, or equivalently, $a_0 \mid f(y) - a_0$.  Then by theorem 1.1, $a_0 \mid f(y) - a_0 + a_0$, so $a_0 \mid f(y)$.  This means that $f(y)$ is composite.\\
In the other case, $a_0 = 0$, let $p$ be a natural number and let $y = kp$.  This implies that $y > m$ and that $y \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$.  By theorem 3.8, $f(y) \equiv f(0) \pmod{p}$, and since $a_0 = 0$, $f(y) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$.  Now we have that $p \mid f(y)$, so $y$ is composite.\\
In either case, we have found an integer $y > m$ such that $f(y)$ is composite.  By theorem 3.12, $f(y) > f(m)$.  However, because $f(y)$ is composite, it must be an element of $T$ and $f(m)$ is the largest element of $T$.  Therefore we have contradicted our assumption and $S$ must be infinite.
\end{proof}
