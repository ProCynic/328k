%%%Exercise 3.25%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{exer}
A band of $17$ pirates stole a sack of gold coins.  When they tried
to divide the fortune into equal portions, $3$ coins remained.  In
the ensuing brawl over who should get the extra coins, one pirate
was killed.  The coins were redistributed, but this time an equal
division left $10$ coins.  Again they fought about who should get
the remaining coins and another pirate was killed.  Now,
fortunately, the coins could be divided evenly among the surviving
$15$ pirates.  What was the fewest number of coins that could have
been in the sack?
