%%%Theorem 2.25%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $b$, and $n$ be integers.  If $a \mid n$, $b \mid n$, and $(a, b) = 1$, then $ab \mid n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}


%%%Theorem 2.26%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $p$ be prime and let $a$ be an integer.  Then $p$ does not divide $a$ if and only if $(a, p) = 1$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}


%%%Theorem 2.27%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $p$ be prime and let $a$ and $b$ be integers. If $p \mid ab$, then $p\mid a$ or $p \mid b$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}

%%%Theorem 2.28%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be integers.  If $(b, c) = 1$, then $(a, bc) = (a, b) \cdot (a, c)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Type your solution here!
\end{proof}

%%%Theorem 2.29%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be integers.  If $(a, b) = 1$ and $(a, c) = 1$, then \\$(a, bc) = 1$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Type your solution here!
\end{proof}

%%%Theorem 2.30%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.  If $(a, b) = d$, then $({a \over d}, {b \over d}) = 1$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof]
Type your proof here!
\end{proof}

%%%Theorem 2.31%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{thm}
Let $a$, $b$, $u$, and $v$ be integers.  If $(a, b) = 1$ and $u \mid a$ and $v \mid b$, then $(u, v) = 1$.
